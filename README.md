# Single-Nucleotide-Polymorphisms (SNP)

A single nucleotide polymorphism, also known as simple nucleotide polymorphism, (SNP, pronounced snip; plural snips) is a DNA sequence variation occurring commonly within a population (e.g. 1%) in which a single nucleotide - A, T, C or G of a shared sequence differs between members of a biological species (or paired chromosome of the same individual).

**Map SNPs to Genes & Chromosome Loci**
(aka: SNP identifier mapping)

The tool g:SNPense maps human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) to gene names, chromosomal locations and variant consequence terms from Sequence Ontology.
With the rapid growth of whole genome sequencing technology, researchers are uncovering extensive genetic variation and large collections of known SNPs are available for human and other species. In order to easily map SNP identifiers (e.g. rs4244285) to gene names, chromosomal coordinates and retrieve their functional consequences we now provide a new service called g:SNPense. Information about genome variants is retrieved from dbSNP and mapped to NCBI Genes. Potential functional consequences of the variants are retrieved from Ensembl Variation data and grouped into 35 Sequence Ontology terms of various severity.

Here is an example with: rs4244285
